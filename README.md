# Connected by AI: Peer Community Powered Art

Introducing "Connected by AI: Peer Community Powered Art," an innovative interactive exhibit created in the Computer Science Experience Labs, where human connection and technology unite.

Experience the fusion of AI and collective creativity as you and a partner inspire a latent diffusion model to algorithmically craft a digital masterpiece unique to your connection. Revel in the fleeting present; each day's theme dissolves, giving way to a new, ephemeral motif celebrating our beautiful, brief moments together.

Join us in Sitterson Hall as we explore the possibilities of human interaction amplified by AI, blurring the boundaries between art, technology, and the power of a connected community.
